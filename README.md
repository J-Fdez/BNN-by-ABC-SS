# BNN-by-ABC-SS
Bayesian neural networks trained with approximate Bayesian computation

This code is a basic implementation of the methodology presented in the research
article "Uncertainty quantification in Neural Networks by Approximate Bayesian
Computation: Application to fatigue in composite materials" in the journal 
Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence.

I hope you find BNN by ABC-SS useful, and please share your ideas if you find new ways 
of improving its performance.
